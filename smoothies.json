A squeeze of lemon or lime juice will help prevent oxidation and stop it going brown. Always cover or store it in a sealed jar in the fridge to preserve the nutrients as much as possible.

If you do make it the night before you might notice that the flavours change (depending on the ingredients), but many people prefer a slightly earthier taste. A squeeze of lemon or lime juice will help prevent oxidation and stop it going brown. Always cover or store it in a sealed jar in the fridge to preserve the nutrients as much as possible.
